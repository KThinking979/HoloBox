If you choose not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to review some key points about HoloBox privacy practices:

Apps are photo editors that allow users to edit portraits with highly realistic facial transformations.

We do not use the Photos you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the editing functionality of the App.

We use third-party cloud providers — specifically Google Cloud Platform — to process and edit photos.

You only send to the cloud the Photos you specifically choose to edit.

Photos are temporarily stored on a cloud server during editing and encrypted with a key stored locally on your mobile device.

The photo will be deleted immediately after finishing the editing process.

Here's more information about our privacy practices.

1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

  When you use the App and select Photos to edit, we cache them for processing to provide the requested editing service:

  Photos you select when using the App, via your camera or photo gallery (if you have given the App access to your camera or photo gallery) or via the internet search function in Application. We only process specific photos that you choose to modify using the App; and we don't collect your photo albums or videos even if you give us access to them. We protect each photo you choose with an encryption key stored locally on your device. This means that the only device that can view the photo is the device to which the photo is sent using the App – the user's device. We take steps to remove any metadata that may be associated with Photos you provide while using the App. Photos will be cached and will be deleted as soon as the editing process is finished. The results will only be saved to your device memory if you want them to.

2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

  We do not use photographs or videos you provide when you use the Apps for any reason other than to provide you with the editing functionality of the Apps.

3. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

  We do not disclose user photographs or videos to third parties (with the exception of temporarily caching an encrypted version with our cloud providers, Google Cloud Platform, to provide the photo and video editing features of the Apps). We cannot share the photos cached for processing as we do not store the encryption keys.
